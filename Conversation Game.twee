//The bartender turned away to prepare my drink. The saloon was pretty empty and only filled with the usuals it seemed. Except there a woman throwing darts and a younger man shooting back whiskey which didn't appear to be something he usually did. //

:: Introduction {"position":"200,100","size":"100,100"}
//The wild bunch forced me out, but I know what they were planning. They think they can plan a heist without me. I’d like to see them try. I have an idea of when the train is going to pass through Rustvale. Though it’s a town I’m unfamiliar with. If I can just get a crew together in time, robbing the train will be easy. 

The town was similar to others I've spent time in. Before I get too into planning I should probably grab a drink. I noticed a Saloon a bit in the distance, it seems promising enough.//

//At the bar there appeared to be a man drinking some sort of sorrow away. He wasn’t showing the emotion in his face, but it was all in the way he was sittin’. He had a revolver attached to his hip. Maybe that meant trouble. And for some reason I could not shake that his face looked familiar.//

(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: Not sure that whiskey is going to solve your problem.]
//He laughed to himself, his gaze still focusing down.//
(text-colour:blue)[???: I realized that after the first.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: Is this a usual spot for you?]
(text-colour:blue)[???: I’m around, I'm assuming you’re also not one to stick around a place too long.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: bold assumption for someone who doesn’t know my name.] 
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: So we’re not skippin pleasantries. I’m Eugene and you?]

(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: Lottie ]

//I’ve had run-ins with this man before that’s why he was so familiar. My old group was not particularly fond of this outlaw//

[[Lottie: Since you seem to know so much about me. What are you doing in this good for nothing town ->Meeting Eugene 3]]

[[And do I get the honors of knowing what sorrow you’re drinking away? ->Meeting Eugene 4]]

(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: Not too sure that’s something I want to disclose with someone like you.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: Someone like me?]
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: Pistol, well built, I’m guessing you’re after some sort of money.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: Right. And someone like you is not after the same.]
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: I never said I wasn’t. But I’m not here for that. I’m trying to lay low. ]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: Aren’t we all. I guess if you are looking for trouble you know where to find me.]
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: I was never one to turn down trouble.]

(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: I went after something I shouldn’t have. Paid the price for it. ]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: What was the price this time?]

//I could tell even thinking about it was paining him. He paused before he spoke as if he was trying to find the right words.//

(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: One that was too great.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: So now you’re taking a break from our line of work.] 
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: Hard for me to stay away. If I hear of something worth it I might change my mind.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: I might have something worth your time.] 
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: I’m listening.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: For now it’s going secret, but if I decide to share can I find you here?]
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: Sure.]
(text-colour:yellow)[Lottie: You know how to fire that revolver?]
(text-colour:blue)[Eugene: With my eyes closed.]

//I make my way over to the dartboard. As I approach, Nelly's gaze drifts to my pistol.//
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': That's quite the piece you've got there. Mind if I take a closer look?]

//He winked and smirked. I paid what I owed.//
