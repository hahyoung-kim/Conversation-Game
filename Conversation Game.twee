//(Lottie’s scans the room and her eyes lock onto the dartboard)//
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': Well, well, look who's showing off their aim tonight]
(text-colour:magenta)[''???:''Admire away. Just trying to keep my skills sharp. Can't let the rust set in now, can we? But don't get too distracted by my skills, darling.]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': //(Laughs)// My name is Lottie Burnham. ]
(text-colour:magenta)[''???:'' Nelly Collins]
//(Lottie makes her way over to the dartboard. As she approaches, Nelly's gaze drifts to Lottie's pistol.)//
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': That's quite the piece you've got there. Mind if I take a closer look?]
(text-colour:yellow)[''[Lottie]:'' Careful now. That's my lucky charm you're holding.]
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly:'' Looks like it's seen its fair share of action]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie:'' You could say that. But enough about my pistol. How about we make things interesting? Care to place a bet on our next round of darts?]

Lottie: You've got guts, I'll give you that, Nelly. But if you're willing to bet your skills against my pistol, who am I to refuse a challenge?

(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly:'' [smiles] How about we put your lucky pistol on the line? I've got a taste for luxury, and that beauty looks like it could fetch a pretty penny.]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie:'' You've got guts, I'll give you that, Nelly. But if you're willing to bet your skills against my pistol, who am I to refuse a challenge?]

(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': Looks like luck was on my side tonight Nelly. Your sharpshooting skills are impressive. I’ve got a proposition for you. I’m forming a crew to pull off the heist of the century]
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': A heist? Now that sounds like my kind of challenge. Tell me more!]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': There’s a train that's passing through Rustvale tomorrow night with a shipment full of gold. I’m planning on getting it before another gang does. How about it?]
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': Count me in but only if we have a crew capable of pulling this off.]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'':// (determined)// Leave that to me, Nelly. I'll round up the best of the best, and we'll meet back here tomorrow night to iron out the details.]

(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': //(smirking triumphantly)// Looks like luck was on my side tonight, Lottie. Hand over that pistol, darling.]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': Well Played. How about instead of my pistol, a proposition? You ever heard of the train that's passing through Rustvale tomorrow night?]
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': Can't say I have, but but I'm guessing you're about to fill me in]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': //(grinning)// That train's carrying a shipment of gold, and I want to get to it before another wild west gang does. With your sharpshooting skills, I reckon we could beat them to the punch.]
(text-colour:magenta)[''Nelly'': A heist? Now that sounds like my kind of challenge. Count me in but only if we have a crew capable of pulling this off.]
(text-colour:yellow)[''Lottie'': //(determined)// Leave that to me, Nelly. I'll round up the best of the best, and we'll meet back here tomorrow night to iron out the details.]
